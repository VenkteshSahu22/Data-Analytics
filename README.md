## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As a data science anthusiast, I like to work on such type of project works.
 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas.
